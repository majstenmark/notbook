# Notebook
This repo contains :rainbow: :rainbow: :rainbow: (Rainbow Unicode Characters) notebook for ACM-competitions.

All the code is found in the code/ folder. 

notebook.pdf might not continue to be up to date. I try to only push stable versions of the pdf.

The code is somewhat tested, but I'm planning to include tests in this repo in the future.

Install dependencies for Ubuntu/Debian with:
- `sudo apt-get install make texlive-full python-pygments`
Or for MacOS:
- `brew cask install mactex` 
- `sudo easy_install Pygments`

Build with `make`.
